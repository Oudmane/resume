# Summary
I'm a Software Developer, I'm always curious about how things work and why it works. I've being coding since I was 15, I got my first job at 19, When I'm free, I work on side projects or learn new skills, When my brain is like: "brah, can I have a break", I watch Movies/TV Shows, or play games.
I'm a contagious developer, I like to infect others with what I've learned so far
